Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build the Skype loading animation using C4. 

This is what the animation looks like:

![](){: data-id="ElementaryNaturalGalapagoshawk" .gfyitem }

This is a great animation to write a tutorial on because although it looks great, it's fairly simple when it's broken down. The circles in the animation are identical, except for their start time and duration. 

A circle begins animating, then after a short delay another circle begins to animate, until all four circles have started animating. To have all the circles converge near the end of their rotation, their animation duration is less their delay.

Now, I'll walk you through the steps to recreate this animation.

> If you haven't already done so, install C4 by following the instructions on our [install tutorial](http://www.c4ios.com/install). The easiest is to use the first option.

    Create a new C4 Project
  
## The Views here are great
Though there are 4 circles in the Skype loading animation, we're going to use an additional 5 invisible views to create the effect we want to achiever.

Let's get to it.

### Create the Views and Circles
In your project's `WorkSpace` add two arrays and a `View` as class variables. Override `setup()` and set the `canvas.backgroundColor` to a nice blue and call `createViewsCircles()`.

{% highlight swift linenos %}
class WorkSpace: CanvasController {
    var views = [View]()
    var circles = [Circle]()
    var container: View!

    override func setup() {
        canvas.backgroundColor = Color(red: 64, green: 177, blue: 239, alpha: 1.0)

        createViewsCircles()
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Create a function called `createViewsCircles()`. In this function, you're going to initialize a container, 4 views and 4 circles. 
{% highlight swift linenos %}    
func createViewsCircles() {
    container = View(frame: Rect(0,0,1,1))
    for _ in 1...4 {
        let v = View(frame: Rect(0,0,10,10))
        views.append(v)

        let c = Circle(center: v.center, radius: v.width/2.0)
        c.lineWidth = 10.0
        c.strokeColor = white
        c.fillColor = white
        circles.append(c)
        v.add(c)
        v.anchorPoint = Point(0.5,7.5)
        v.center = container.center
        container.add(v)
    }
    canvas.add(container)
    container.center = canvas.center
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Run It!
This is what you should see:

![](seeminglySingleDot.png)

It **looks** like a single dot, but dots can be deceiving.

#### What's happening???
This method does the following:

* creates a container 
* loops 4 times, which...
* creates an invisible 10x10 view
* into which a 10x10 white circle is added
* then offsets the anchorPoint of the view
* which is then added to the container
* then the container is added to the center of the canvas

> Changing the anchor point of a view offsets what it "believes" is its center point.

#### Why so complex???
There's a particular motion to the Skype loader. What we found was this:

* The circles start at the top at full-size
* The circles start rotating counter-clockwise
* Each circle's rotation motion is offset by a fraction of a second
* When the circles each arrive at approx. 1/8th of a rotation they shrink
* When the circles each arrive at approx. 7/8th of a rotation they grow
* This process repeats.

From this process we deduced a couple of things:

1. The easing and motion of the resizing of the circles is independent of their rotation
2. The rotation has an `.EaseInOut` effect throughout its entire motion
3. The growth pattern takes up about 1/4 of a full rotation

So,...

1. We use an "non-moving" circle to perform the resize (i.e. not moving within its superview)
2. We rotate the superview of the circle by 180 degrees easing it in and out
3. We rotate the container of each view by 180 degress

> It is the combination of an `.EaseInOut` motion of the view's rotation within the motion of its superview container that creates the proper timing and easing for the entire animation

## Create the Animations
There are two major steps in this section: animate the views, and animate the circles. We'll start with the views.

### View Animations
Add the following class variables and a constant for the duration.
{% highlight swift linenos %}
let duration = 3.0
var viewAnimationGroup: ViewAnimationGroup!
{% endhighlight %}

Then, add the following function to your `WorkSpace`:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func createAnimations() {
    var vanims = [ViewAnimation]()
    for i in 0..<views.count {
        let v = views[i]
        let offset = Double(i) * 0.1 + 0.05
        let va = ViewAnimation(duration: duration/4.0 + 0.3) {
            v.rotation += M_PI
        }
        va.delay = offset
        vanims.append(va)
    }
    viewAnimationGroup = ViewAnimationGroup(animations: vanims)
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Each view starts its rotation with a slight offset. 

Then, call that method in `setup()`...

{% highlight swift linenos %}
override func setup() {
    canvas.backgroundColor = Color(red: 64, green: 177, blue: 239, alpha: 1.0)
    createViewsCircles()
    createAnimations()
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Time it Out
For this example, we're going to trigger the animations with a repeating timer. Add the following variable to your `WorkSpace`:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
var animationTimer: Timer!
{% endhighlight %}

Then, at the end of `setup()`, right after creating the animations, add the following:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
animationTimer = Timer(interval: duration/4.0) {
    self.viewAnimationGroup.animate()
}
animationTimer.start()
animationTimer.fire()
{% endhighlight %}

#### Run it!
Press play, and you should see this:

![](){: data-id="SeriousFrequentGander" .gfyitem }

The simple motion of the views.

### Shrink and Grow
Now, let's modify the `createAnimations()` function to generate animations for the shrinking and growing of each circle. Add another `ViewAnimationGroup` to the `WorkSpace`:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
var circleAnimationGroup: ViewAnimationGroup!
{% endhighlight %}

Then, modify `createAnimations()` to look like: 

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func createAnimations() {
    var canims = [ViewAnimation]()
    var vanims = [ViewAnimation]()
    for i in 0..<views.count {
        let v = views[i]
        let offset = Double(i) * 0.1 + 0.05
        let va = ViewAnimation(duration: duration/4.0 + 0.3) {
            v.rotation += M_PI
        }
        va.delay = offset
        vanims.append(va)

        let c = circles[i]
        let ca = ViewAnimation(duration: duration/8.0 + 0.15) {
            c.lineWidth = 0.0
        }
        ca.delay = offset
        ca.autoreverses = true
        ca.addCompletionObserver {
            ShapeLayer.disableActions = true
            c.lineWidth = 10.0
            ShapeLayer.disableActions = false
        }
        canims.append(ca)
    }
    viewAnimationGroup = ViewAnimationGroup(animations: vanims)
    circleAnimationGroup = ViewAnimationGroup(animations: canims)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Next, trigger the circle animations from the timer:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
animationTimer = Timer(interval: duration/4.0) {
    self.viewAnimationGroup.animate()
    self.circleAnimationGroup.animate()
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Run it, Again!
Press play, and you should see this:

![](){: data-id="GorgeousLegalBunny" .gfyitem }

Nice. Almost there...

### Container Animation
The container also needs to rotate, so the last step is to create an animation to handle that. In `setup()` add the last bit of code.

{% highlight swift linenos %}
let containerAnim = ViewAnimation(duration: duration) {
    self.container.rotation += 2*M_PI
}
containerAnim.curve = .Linear
containerAnim.repeats = true
containerAnim.animate()
{% endhighlight %}

## Call Ended.
Run your app now and you should see something that looks like this:

![](){: data-id="ElementaryNaturalGalapagoshawk" .gfyitem }

That was an easy one...

> Actually, it took us a long time to decipher the motion of the circles and figure out how to re-construct the animation usin layers and layers of views.
