Now we need to work on the selector. The easiest way to see if we‚Äôre getting things right is to make sure the menu is OUT while we‚Äôre testing. To do this, modify your project's `WorkSpace` to have the following `setup()`:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
override func setup() {
    canvas.backgroundColor = COSMOSbkgd
    
    let rings = MenuRings()
    rings.canvas.center = canvas.center
    canvas.add(rings.canvas)
    rings.revealDashedRings?.animate()
    rings.revealHideDividingLines(1.0)
    rings.thickRingOut?.animate()
    rings.thinRingsOut?.animate()
    
    let icons = MenuIcons()
    icons.canvas.center = canvas.center
    canvas.add(icons.canvas)
    icons.signIconsOut?.animate()
    icons.revealSignIcons?.animate()
}
{% endhighlight %}

When you run the app it should look like this:

![](01.png)

Now, the goal of this chapter is to make sure that when the user drags around the menu a selector will appear for whichever element their thumb is over top of. It should look like:

![](){: data-id="VainTautKagu" .gfyitem }

We‚Äôre going to need to combine the following things to get it to work:

a long press gesture that tracks the user‚Äôs touch
a method that converts the position of the touch to an angle / position in the menu
a shape that acts as a highlight
allow the gesture to trigger the in/out animations

## Add the gesture

The first step is to attach a gesture to the canvas and to start tracking the position of the user‚Äôs touch.

Open `MenuSelector.swift` and add the following two methods to your class:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func createGesture() {
    canvas.addLongPressGestureRecognizer { (location, state) -> () in
        switch state {
        case .Changed:
            self.update(location)
        default:
            _ = ""
        }
    }
}

func update(location: C4Point) {
    print(location)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, add modify `setup()` to look like this:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
public override func setup() {
    canvas.frame = C4Rect(0,0,80,80)
    canvas.backgroundColor = C4Pink
    createGesture()
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, go back to your project's `WorkSpace` and add the following to the `setup()` there:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
class WorkSpace: C4CanvasController {
    override func setup() {
      canvas.backgroundColor = COSMOSbkgd
        
        let rings = MenuRings()
        rings.canvas.center = canvas.center
        canvas.add(rings.canvas)
        rings.revealDashedRings?.animate()
        rings.revealHideDividingLines(1.0)
        rings.thickRingOut?.animate()
        rings.thinRingsOut?.animate()
        
        let icons = MenuIcons()
        icons.canvas.center = canvas.center
        canvas.add(icons.canvas)
        icons.signIconsOut?.animate()
        icons.revealSignIcons?.animate()
        
        let selector = MenuSelector()
        selector.canvas.center = canvas.center
        canvas.add(selector.canvas)
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Run it, and you should see this:

![](){: data-id="FaithfulOrganicBigmouthbass" .gfyitem }

And when you long press then drag, starting on the pink box, you should see the current position of the touch update constantly in the console.

![](02.png)

We‚Äôre using the `switch` statement now to check when the touch is updated, but by default the method does nothing. For now we are testing the drag / changed component of the gesture, eventually we‚Äôre going to track the beginning and end states as well.

## Calculate the Angles

We need to know the angle from the center of the canvas to wherever the user‚Äôs touch is, and when calculating the angles between points, it‚Äôs important to remember three things.

First, calculating an angle always defaults to the smallest positive angle (so we‚Äôll need to adjust for this). The following two states return equivalent values:

![](03.png)

Second, we‚Äôre going to work with a coordinate system that starts on the right and rotates clockwise.

![](04.png)

Third, we need 3 points to calculate the angle between the user‚Äôs touch and the center of the screen. The points are: a) an arbitrary point on the x-axis to the right of the center, b) the center point, c) the touch point. With these three points we can calculate the angle:

![](05.png)

Replace the contents of `update(location:)` with:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
let a = C4Vector(x:self.canvas.width / 2.0+1.0, y:self.canvas.height/2.0)
let b = C4Vector(x:self.canvas.width / 2.0, y:self.canvas.height/2.0)
let c = C4Vector(x:location.x, y:location.y)

var œ¥ = c.angleTo(a, basedOn: b)
print(œ¥)
{% endhighlight %}

Run it. Notice that when the touch drags across the x-axis on the left-hand side of the screen that the values to up to ùúã then starts going back down to zero. Here‚Äôs how we adjust for that:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
if c.y < a.y {
    œ¥ = 2*M_PI - œ¥
}
{% endhighlight %}

> Place this right before `print(œ¥)`.

We‚Äôre going to want to convert œ¥ to an index based on the number of divisions in our menu. There are 12 divisions and the menu is 360‚àò (a full circle) so we will modify the value like this:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
let index = Int(radToDeg(œ¥)) / 30
{% endhighlight %}

Now we know in which section of the menu our point is generally sitting.

Finally, change the print statement to:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
print(index)
{% endhighlight %}

Run it, and you‚Äôll see that you get a number from 0 to 11 instead of radian values.

## The Highlight

The highlight is supposed to pop up in the area surrounding an icon. So‚Ä¶ It has a weird shape.

![](06.png)

We could do some tricky thing were where figure out the exact arcs and dimension of a shape, then rotate that thing around, but‚Ä¶ I prefer to do things a little simpler.

First, we‚Äôre going to use a wedge to define the highlight. The wedge is a pie slice out of a circle, so it‚Äôs outer edge is already rounded. Let‚Äôs build a wedge and add it to the menu.

Add the following variable to your class:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
var highlight : C4Shape!
{% endhighlight %}

Then, add this method:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func createHighlight() {
    highlight = C4Wedge(center: canvas.center, radius: 156, start: M_PI/6.0, end: 0.0, clockwise: false)
    highlight.fillColor = COSMOSblue
    highlight.lineWidth = 0.0
    highlight.opacity = 0.8
    highlight.interactionEnabled = false
    highlight.anchorPoint = C4Point()
    highlight.center = canvas.center
    
    canvas.add(highlight)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, call that method in `setup()`:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
public override func setup() {
    canvas.frame = C4Rect(0,0,80,80)
    canvas.backgroundColor = C4Pink
    createGesture()
    createHighlight()
}
{% endhighlight %}

Run it, and you should see:

![](07.png)

What we‚Äôve done is created a wedge that sits at the first position (e.g. 0) of our menu. It‚Äôs anchorPoint is set to the top-left corner of its view and is the point around which we will rotate the shape. The rest of the code is essentially layout.

### Donut that Wedge

We want to get rid of the part of the wedge that is outside of the ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù of the icon. The easiest way to do this is to mask the wedge.

Add the following to `createHighlight()` right before adding the wedge to the canvas:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
let donut = C4Circle(center: highlight.center, radius: 156-54/2.0)
donut.fillColor = clear
donut.lineWidth = 54
highlight.mask = donut
{% endhighlight %}

Run it!

![](08.png)

Wham!

This creates a circle whose diameter goes to the mid-point of the icon‚Äôs container, and whose lineWidth fills the entire container. It then uses that shape as a mask where anything opaque is revealed, and anything clear is hidden.

This is what the donut looks like if it is added to the wedge:

![The wedge is contained to the space of the icon.](09.png)
![The position of the donut. Without the interface (left) underneath the interface (right)](10.png)

### Move It

Now, we‚Äôre going to attach the position of the highlight to the gesture we‚Äôve already made.

Add the following at the end of `update(location:)`:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
let rotation = C4Transform.makeRotation(degToRad(Double(index) * 30.0), axis: C4Vector(x: 0,y: 0,z: -1))
highlight.transform = rotation 
{% endhighlight %}

Run it:

![](){: data-id="SnivelingFlamboyantFieldspaniel" .gfyitem }

## A Few Behaviours

We want the behaviour of the wedge to follow these rules:

Trigger the change in position only once as the user‚Äôs touch moves into a new icon
Highlight only when the user‚Äôs touch is over top of one of the icons
Hide the highlight when the user‚Äôs touch is not over an icon
Create a class variable to mark the current selection, like so:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
var currentSelection = -1
{% endhighlight %}

Then, modify `update()` with some logic to check if the current selection is the same as the index that was just calculated:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
if currentSelection != index {
    currentSelection = index
    let rotation = C4Transform.makeRotation(degToRad(Double(currentSelection) * 30.0), axis: C4Vector(x: 0,y: 0,z: -1))
    highlight.transform = rotation
}
{% endhighlight %}

This won‚Äôt look like much on screen, but trust me: it‚Äôs preventing updating every time the user‚Äôs touch moves, and only updating when they‚Äôve rolled over into a new section of the menu.

Then, wrap the logic in an `if-else` that checks the distance of the user‚Äôs touch from the center of the canvas. Since we‚Äôre dealing with a circle, any time the user‚Äôs touch is between `102` and `156` points from the center of the canvas we know it‚Äôs in the area of the icons.

The end of `update()` should now look like this:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
let dist = distance(location, rhs: self.canvas.bounds.center)

if dist > 102 && dist < 156 {
    if currentSelection != index {
        currentSelection = index
        let rotation = C4Transform.makeRotation(degToRad(Double(currentSelection) * 30.0), axis: C4Vector(x: 0,y: 0,z: -1))
        highlight.transform = rotation
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

And, when you run it you should see that the highlight only updates whenever the touch is within the bounds of the icon ring:

![](){: data-id="CapitalCarefreeIceblueredtopzebra" .gfyitem }

Finally, add the following to `createHighlight()`:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
highlight.hidden = true
{% endhighlight %}

And, turn the previous if statement into an if-else where that toggles the hiding / revealing of the highlight:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
if dist > 102 && dist < 156 {
    highlight.hidden = false
    if currentSelection != index {
        currentSelection = index
        let rotation = C4Transform.makeRotation(degToRad(Double(currentSelection) * 30.0), axis: C4Vector(x: 0,y: 0,z: -1))
        highlight.transform = rotation
    }
} else {
    highlight.hidden = true
}
{% endhighlight %}

If the user‚Äôs touch is in the icon area we reveal the highlight by setting its hidden property to `false`, and if the touch falls outside that area we hide the highlight again.

Last, but not least, we want the highlight to hide when the user touch ends. To do this we add a bit of logic to our gesture:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
case .Cancelled, .Ended, .Failed:
    currentSelection = -1
    highlight.hidden = true
{% endhighlight %}

> `currentSelection = -1` is included here because we want the selection to be reset whenever the gesture ends.

This logic states that if the gesture is canceled, or failed (states that are governed by the device) or if it is ended (based on the user‚Äôs action) then we check to see if the highlight is visible, and if so it hides it.

The whole gesture method should look like:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func createGesture() {
    //add a long press gesture to the menu's canvas
    canvas.addLongPressGestureRecognizer { (location, state) -> () in
        switch state {
        case .Changed:
            self.update(location)
        case .Cancelled, .Ended, .Failed:
            self.currentSelection = -1
      self.highlight.hidden == true
        default:
            _ = ""
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

And, this is what things should look like:

![](){: data-id="NeighboringAgonizingAztecant" .gfyitem }

## Menu Label

The label will be centered in the menu and will show the name of the astrological sign the user is currently selecting.

Create a class variable like so:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
var menuLabel : C4TextShape!
{% endhighlight %}

And, add the following method:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func createLabel() {
    let f = C4Font(name: "Menlo-Regular", size: 13)!
    menuLabel = C4TextShape(text: "COSMOS", font: f)!
    menuLabel.center = canvas.center
    menuLabel.fillColor = white
    menuLabel.interactionEnabled = false
    canvas.add(menuLabel)
    menuLabel.hidden = true
}
{% endhighlight %}

Add a call to `createLabel()` to `setup()`.

Then, in `update(location:)`, just above `highlight.hidden = false` add the following:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
menuLabel.hidden = false
{% endhighlight %}

And, inside the following `if` statement, add this logic:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
C4ShapeLayer.disableActions = true
menuLabel?.text = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.order[index].capitalizedString
menuLabel?.center = canvas.bounds.center
C4ShapeLayer.disableActions = false
{% endhighlight %}

This updates the text of the label while disabling Core Animation‚Äôs implicit animation which happens because we‚Äôre changing the path of a shape.

Then, in the final `else` of the same method, hide the menu label like this:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
menuLabel.hidden = true
{% endhighlight %}

You also want to add the `hidden = true` line to the `.Cancelled` case of the long press gesture.

Your `update(location:)` should now look like this:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func update(location: C4Point) {
    let a = C4Vector(x:self.canvas.width / 2.0+1.0, y:self.canvas.height/2.0)
    let b = C4Vector(x:self.canvas.width / 2.0, y:self.canvas.height/2.0)
    let c = C4Vector(x:location.x, y:location.y)
    
    var œ¥ = c.angleTo(a, basedOn: b)
    
    if c.y < a.y {
        œ¥ = 2*M_PI - œ¥
    }
    
    let index = Int(radToDeg(œ¥)) / 30
    
    let dist = distance(location, rhs: self.canvas.bounds.center)

    if dist > 102 && dist < 156 {
        menuLabel.hidden = false
        highlight.hidden = false
        if currentSelection != index {
            C4ShapeLayer.disableActions = true
            menuLabel?.text = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.order[index].capitalizedString
            menuLabel?.center = canvas.bounds.center
            C4ShapeLayer.disableActions = false
            
            currentSelection = index
            let rotation = C4Transform.makeRotation(degToRad(Double(currentSelection) * 30.0), axis: C4Vector(x: 0,y: 0,z: -1))
            highlight.transform = rotation
        }
    } else {
        highlight.hidden = true
        menuLabel.hidden = true
        currentSelection = -1
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Your `setup()` should look like:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
public override func setup() {
    canvas.frame = C4Rect(0,0,80,80)
    canvas.backgroundColor = C4Pink
    createGesture()
    createHighlight()
    createLabel()
}
{% endhighlight %}

And, this is what your app should act like when you run it:

![](){: data-id="NiceInfiniteBlueshark" .gfyitem }

## Info Button

We chose to include in the app an info panel with a bit of text about the app and a link to the C4 site. Since we‚Äôll access this panel from the menu we need to also include an info button.

Add a class-level variable to your project like so:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
var infoButton : C4View!
{% endhighlight %}

We are going to use a view as our button because we want to do a little trick.

First, we‚Äôre going to use the standard info image from iOS which looks like this:

![](11.png)

I‚Äôve previously grabbed the image by running the following code in another project:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
let button = UIButton(type: UIButtonType.InfoLight)
button.imageView?.tintColor = UIColor.whiteColor()
let img = button.imageForState(.Normal)

let fileManager = NSFileManager.defaultManager()
let data = UIImagePNGRepresentation(img!)
fileManager.createFileAtPath("/Users/travis/Desktop/info.png", contents: data, attributes: nil)
{% endhighlight %}

This gave me an image that I loaded into Photoshop, inverted its color to white, then exported all 3 size assets.

The standard size of the info button on iOS is 22 x 22 pts, which is quite small. If we made a button this small it would be difficult to hit. So‚Ä¶

Having our `infoButton` be a `C4View` allows us to make the hit area of our button larger than the image we‚Äôre going to show.

Copy the following method into your class:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func createInfoButton() {
    infoButton = C4View(frame: C4Rect(0,0,44,44))
    let buttonImage = C4Image("info")!
    buttonImage.interactionEnabled = false
    buttonImage.center = infoButton.center
    infoButton.add(buttonImage)
    infoButton.opacity = 1.0
    infoButton.center = C4Point(canvas.center.x, canvas.center.y+190.0)
    canvas.add(infoButton)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Fairly straightforward: make a small image, make a larger view, add the image to the view, add the view to the canvas and hide it.

Next, add two more variables and a method for creating the animations to reveal / hide the button:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
var revealInfoButton : C4ViewAnimation?
var hideInfoButton : C4ViewAnimation?

func createInfoButtonAnimations() {
  revealInfoButton = C4ViewAnimation(duration:0.33) {
    self.infoButton?.opacity = 1.0
  }
  revealInfoButton?.curve = .EaseOut

  hideInfoButton = C4ViewAnimation(duration:0.33) {
    self.infoButton?.opacity = 0.0
  }
  hideInfoButton?.curve = .EaseOut
}
{% endhighlight %}

We won‚Äôt bother with these animations yet, they‚Äôll come into play in a later chapter.

Finally, we want to check if the user‚Äôs touch is over top of the info button, and since the button is outside of the icon menu, add the following to the `else` at the end of `update`:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
if let l = infoButton  {
    if l.hitTest(location, from:canvas) {
        menuLabel.hidden = false
        C4ShapeLayer.disableActions = true
        menuLabel.text = "Info"
        menuLabel.center = canvas.bounds.center
        C4ShapeLayer.disableActions = false
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## The Sound of Menu

We want the selector to also trigger some sounds. Eventually, the selector will be synced with the opening and closing of the menu, so we‚Äôll handle three things here:

1. A tick for when the user‚Äôs touch rolls into a new icon
2. A menu open sound
3. A menu close sound

Add the following three variables to you class:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
let tick = C4AudioPlayer("tick.mp3")!
{% endhighlight %}

Then, in `setup` add this:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
tick.volume = 0.4
{% endhighlight %}

Then, right inside of the if `currentSelection != index {...}` add this:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
tick.stop()
tick.play()
{% endhighlight %}

The reason why we call `stop()` is because Core Audio defaults to waiting for a sound to finish playing before playing it again. Stopping it right before playing removes the potential delay in playing if the user is moving their thumb around the menu very quickly.

Run it, and you‚Äôll hear some nice little sounds play out.

## Clean Up

Now, change `setup()` to:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
public override func setup() {
    //create the frame, small like the other classes
    canvas.frame = C4Rect(0,0,80,80)
    canvas.backgroundColor = clear
    createHighlight()
    createLabel()
    createInfoButton()
    createInfoButtonAnimations()
    tick.volume = 0.4
}
{% endhighlight %}

Also, remove all the junk we put into `setup()` in your project's `WorkSpace`.

Eventually, we‚Äôre going to create the gesture somewhere else and remove it from this class. 

You can grab the current state of [MenuSelector.swift](https://gist.github.com/C4Framework/fc16b1e3552a9de94955).

Breathe.

You‚Äôre doing good.

We‚Äôre almost done.
