Next, we want to add the icons to our menu and animate them in. The design concept for the icons is straightforward: they start as a dot, move out to their final position, and animate to their full shape.

## Positioning

The tricky part of this step isn’t the animation and movement – those are easy – but the positioning of each shape so that it looks like they are dots that turn into full shapes. There are a few ways of thinking about how to do this:

1. create a dot, and a shape, hide the shape until the dot animates into position, hide the dot and reveal the shape
2. create a dot made up of the same points as the shape, move the dot into position and morph the dot into shape
3. have the “dot” not actually be a dot, but just look like one by setting the shape’s `strokeEnd` to the right position and its `lineCap` to `.Round`

We’re going to use the `strokeEnd` to manage the animating of the icons, so the third option is the best approach. However, the problem with this approach is that each of the “starting” points for the shapes will be different – we will need to offset them either on the dot or full icon end of the animation.

Here’s the icon for Capricorn, with its start point highlighted:

![](02.png)

The position of the start point is `{30.0,12.2}`, which with respect to its frame is `{0.750,0.387}`.

To create the effect of a “dot” we simply set the following on each of the icons:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
shape.strokeEnd = 0.001
shape.lineCap = .Round
{% endhighlight %}

If we use the center of the icon to position, the menu will look like this for its closed and open states.

![](03.png)
![](04.png)

If we use the first point as the `anchorPoint` of the shape we get the following:

![](05.png)
![](06.png)

Our ideal is using the `anchorPoint` for the closed state, and the `center` for the second state. But, this will get complicated if we are constantly switching positions. So, we’ll have to use the `anchorPoint` to calculate the actual `center` of the icon at one of the states and then use just the center to move it back and forth between those states afterwards.

Let’s get to it.

## Grab the Icons

The first step is to grab the icons out of the sign provider, and update their anchor points.

Open `MenuIcons.swift` and add the following methods to the class:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func taurus() -> C4Shape {
    let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.taurus().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point()
  return shape
}

func aries() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.aries().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(0.0777,0.536)
  return shape
}

func gemini() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.gemini().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(0.996,0.0)
  return shape
}

func cancer() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.cancer().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(0.0,0.275)
  return shape
}

func leo() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.leo().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(0.379,0.636)
  return shape
}

func virgo() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.virgo().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(0.750,0.387)
  return shape
}

func libra() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.libra().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(1.00,0.559)
  return shape
}

func pisces() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.pisces().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(0.099,0.004)
  return shape
}

func aquarius() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.aquarius().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(0.0,0.263)
  return shape
}

func sagittarius() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.sagittarius().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(1.0,0.349)
  return shape
}

func capricorn() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.capricorn().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(0.288,0.663)
  return shape
}

func scorpio() -> C4Shape {
  let shape = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.scorpio().shape
  shape.anchorPoint = C4Point(0.255,0.775)
  return shape
} 
{% endhighlight %}

Each of those methods grabs the raw icon from the sign provider and sets the anchor point to the start point of icon. We don’t need any of the other details from the sign (e.g. big / small points, lines, etc.) so we return only the shape with a modified anchor point.

Next, we also want to have a stored copy of the signs we’re working with because we’ll manipulate them a bit. So, we create a variable shape dictionary to store the signs and a method that will create and style them for us:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
var signIcons : [String:C4Shape]!
{% endhighlight %}

Then, add the following method to your class:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func createSignIcons() {
    signIcons = [String:C4Shape]()
    signIcons["aries"] = aries()
    signIcons["taurus"] = taurus()
    signIcons["gemini"] = gemini()
    signIcons["cancer"] = cancer()
    signIcons["leo"] = leo()
    signIcons["virgo"] = virgo()
    signIcons["libra"] = libra()
    signIcons["scorpio"] = scorpio()
    signIcons["sagittarius"] = sagittarius()
    signIcons["capricorn"] = capricorn()
    signIcons["aquarius"] = aquarius()
    signIcons["pisces"] = pisces()
    
    for shape in [C4Shape](self.signIcons.values) {
        shape.strokeEnd = 0.001 //in combination with the next two settings
        shape.lineCap = .Round  //strokeEnd 0.001 makes a round dot at
        shape.lineJoin = .Round //the beginning of the shape's path
        
        shape.transform = C4Transform.makeScale(0.64, 0.64, 1.0)
        shape.lineWidth = 2
        shape.strokeColor = white
        shape.fillColor = clear
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The shape we’re getting out of the sign provider is raw, so we need to scale it to fit our design. If we don’t apply the following:

shape.transform = C4Transform.makeScale(0.64, 0.64, 1.0)
Then the shapes would be too big and look like this:

![](07.png)

## Target Positions

Next, we need to calculate the target positions for each of the shapes and store them in two arrays. Add the following variables to your class:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
var innerTargets : [C4Point]!
var outerTargets : [C4Point]!
{% endhighlight %}

Then, add the following method:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func positionSignIcons() {
    innerTargets = [C4Point]()
    let provider = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance
    let r = 10.5
    let dx = canvas.center.x
    let dy = canvas.center.y
    for i in 0..<provider.order.count {
        let ϴ = M_PI/6 * Double(i)
        let name = provider.order[i]
        if let sign = signIcons[name] {
            sign.center = C4Point(r * cos(ϴ) + dx, r * sin(ϴ) + dy)
            canvas.add(sign)
            sign.anchorPoint = C4Point(0.5,0.5)
            innerTargets.append(sign.center)
        }
    }
    
    outerTargets = [C4Point]()
    for i in 0..<provider.order.count {
        let r = 129.0
        let ϴ = M_PI/6 * Double(i) + M_PI/12.0
        outerTargets.append(C4Point(r * cos(ϴ) + dx, r * sin(ϴ) + dy))
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The process above takes advantage of the following concepts:

1. In creating the shapes we’ve already set the `anchorPoint` to each one’s start point
2. Calling `shape.center` actually returns the position of the shape’s `anchorPoint` with respect to the shape’s `superview`
3. Adjusting the `anchorPoint` back to the shapes `center` (e.g. `{0.5,0.5}`) won’t change the shape's position
4. After resetting the `anchorPoint` we are able to grab the actual center position of the shape and use this as a target

Finally, at the end of `createSignIcons`, after styling all the signs, add the following:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
positionSignIcons()
{% endhighlight %}

Now, let’s have a look at how these line up.

### Check It.

Change the `backgroundColor` of the menu to `C4Purple` and create the sign icons. Your `setup()` should look like this:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
public override func setup() {
    canvas.backgroundColor = COSMOSbkgd
    createSignIcons()
}
{% endhighlight %}

And, go to your project's `WorkSpace` and update the `setup()` there to look like:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
override func setup() {
    canvas.add(MenuIcons().canvas)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Run it, and you should see this:

![](08.png)

## Animating the icons

There are 4 different animations we need to create: position out / in, shape reveal / hide. So, create 4 animation variables like so:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
var signIconsOut : C4ViewAnimation!
var signIconsIn : C4ViewAnimation!
var revealSignIcons : C4ViewAnimation!
var hideSignIcons : C4ViewAnimation!
{% endhighlight %}

Then add this method:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func createSignIconAnimations() {
}
{% endhighlight %}

The reason we need 4 animations is based on our design, specifically the order in which we animate the lines out and in is different in either direction:

OUT: move, reveal
IN: hide, move

Since the pattern is backwards when animating in we’re required to have separate animations for moving and for revealing that we can then order in a sequence. Add the following to the blank method:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
revealSignIcons = C4ViewAnimation(duration: 0.5) {
    for sign in [C4Shape](self.signIcons.values) {
        sign.strokeEnd = 1.0
    }
}
revealSignIcons?.curve = .EaseOut

hideSignIcons = C4ViewAnimation(duration: 0.5) {
    for sign in [C4Shape](self.signIcons.values) {
        sign.strokeEnd = 0.001
    }
}
hideSignIcons?.curve = .EaseOut
{% endhighlight %}

A couple of things to note here:

1. Having separate animations allows us to customize the easing for each step
2. We can also specify the durations for either direction
3. We set the stroke end back to `0.001` to preserve the dot

Now, add the following to the `createSignIconAnimations`:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
signIconsOut = C4ViewAnimation(duration: 0.33) {
    for i in 0..<AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.order.count {
        let name = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.order[i]
        if let sign = self.signIcons[name] {
            sign.center = self.outerTargets[i]
        }
    }
}
signIconsOut?.curve = .EaseOut

//moves icons to closed position
signIconsIn = C4ViewAnimation(duration: 0.33) {
    for i in 0..<AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.order.count {
        let name = AstrologicalSignProvider.sharedInstance.order[i]
        if let sign = self.signIcons[name] {
            sign.center = self.innerTargets[i]
        }
    }
}
signIconsIn?.curve = .EaseOut
{% endhighlight %}

Here all we’re doing is grabbing the icons and either setting their center to the outer or inner positions.

### Check It.

Test the animations by calling the reveal and move animations like so:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
func animOut() {
    delay(1.0) {
        self.signIconsOut?.animate()
    }

    delay(1.5) {
        self.revealSignIcons?.animate()
    }
    
    delay(2.5) {
        self.animIn()
    }
}

func animIn() {
    delay(0.25) {
        self.hideSignIcons?.animate()
    }

    delay(1.0) {
        self.signIconsIn?.animate()
    }

    delay(2.5) {
        self.animOut()
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then call `animOut()` at the end of `setup()`, which should look like this:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
public override func setup() {
    canvas.backgroundColor = COSMOSbkgd
    createSignIcons()
    createSignIconAnimations()
    animOut()
}
{% endhighlight %}

You should see this:

![](){: data-id="NeighboringTerribleFieldspaniel" .gfyitem }

## Clean Up

Now, delete `animIn` and `animOut` methods and make your `setup()` look like this:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
public override func setup() {
    canvas.frame = C4Rect(0,0,80,80)
    canvas.backgroundColor = clear
    createSignIcons()
    createSignIconAnimations()
}
{% endhighlight %}

Baddabing!
