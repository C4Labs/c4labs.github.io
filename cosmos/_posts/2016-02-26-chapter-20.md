After the last chapter’s marathon of coding, this one is a cinch. We need a shadow to appear underneath the menu, so we need 3 things:

1. A shadow object
2. A reveal animation
3. A hide animation

Keeping consistent with the various layers we’re creating as separate `C4CanvasController` objects, we’re going to do the same here.

In `MenuShadow.swift` simply paste the following into the body of the class:

{% highlight swift lineos %}
var reveal : C4ViewAnimation?
var hide : C4ViewAnimation?

public override func setup() {
    canvas.frame = C4Rect(UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds)
    canvas.backgroundColor = black
    canvas.opacity = 0.0
    createShadowAnimations()
}

func createShadowAnimations() {
    reveal = C4ViewAnimation(duration:0.25) {
        self.canvas.opacity = 0.44
    }
    reveal?.curve = .EaseOut
    
    hide = C4ViewAnimation(duration:0.25) {
        self.canvas.opacity = 0.0
    }
    hide?.curve = .EaseOut
}
{% endhighlight %}

That’s it.

Since this class is so simple, we’re not going to test it. We’ll see its effect in the next chapter when we pull the entire menu together.

Here’s a copy of the [MenuShadow.swift](https://gist.github.com/C4Framework/afdda9aacef565588e26).
